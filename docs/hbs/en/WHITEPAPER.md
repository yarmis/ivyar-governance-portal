## Executive Summary

The Humanitarian Budget Support (HBS) framework represents a comprehensive approach to ethical, transparent, and accountable budget support in humanitarian contexts. Built on principles of human dignity, local empowerment, and sustainable impact, HBS provides a structured methodology for delivering financial assistance that respects agency, builds capacity, and creates lasting positive change.

This whitepaper outlines the theoretical foundation, operational framework, and implementation guidelines for HBS, designed for use by humanitarian organizations, donors, governments, and implementing partners.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Need

Traditional humanitarian assistance often focuses on in-kind aid and service delivery. While essential in acute emergencies, this approach can inadvertently undermine local markets, create dependency, and fail to address systemic vulnerabilities. Budget support—providing direct financial resources to governments or communities—offers an alternative that can strengthen local systems, preserve dignity, and enable self-directed recovery.

However, budget support in humanitarian contexts carries significant risks: corruption, mismanagement, lack of accountability, and potential harm to vulnerable populations. The HBS framework addresses these challenges through:

- Rigorous ethical safeguards
- Transparent governance mechanisms
- Community-centered design
- Adaptive learning systems
- Evidence-based decision-making

### 1.2 Purpose and Scope

This whitepaper serves multiple audiences:

- **Humanitarian practitioners**: Implementation guidance and operational frameworks
- **Donors and funders**: Accountability mechanisms and impact measurement
- **Government partners**: Integration with national systems and capacity building
- **Affected communities**: Transparency and participation pathways
- **Researchers and academics**: Theoretical foundations and learning agenda

### 1.3 Vision and Mission

**Vision:** A world where humanitarian budget support empowers communities, strengthens systems, and creates sustainable pathways out of crisis.

**Mission:** To provide a rigorous, ethical, and effective framework for humanitarian budget support that prioritizes human dignity, local ownership, and accountable stewardship of resources.

## 2. Core Principles

The HBS framework rests on eight foundational principles:

### 2.1 Human Dignity and Agency

Every person affected by crisis possesses inherent worth and capacity. HBS prioritizes their voices, choices, and leadership in all aspects of budget support design and implementation.

**In practice:**
- Communities participate meaningfully in decision-making
- Recipients maintain control over resource allocation
- Programs respect cultural contexts and local knowledge
- Support builds on existing strengths and capacities

### 2.2 Transparency and Accountability

All stakeholders deserve clear information about budget support: how decisions are made, how resources flow, what outcomes result, and how concerns are addressed.

**In practice:**
- Public disclosure of allocation criteria and processes
- Real-time tracking of financial flows
- Independent oversight and audit mechanisms
- Accessible complaint and redress systems

### 2.3 Local Ownership and Capacity Building

Sustainable impact requires strengthening local systems and actors. HBS invests in building the capacity of government institutions, civil society, and community organizations.

**In practice:**
- Alignment with national development priorities
- Use of country systems where feasible
- Investment in institutional strengthening
- South-South and peer learning opportunities

### 2.4 Sustainability and Long-term Impact

Budget support must contribute to lasting change, not temporary relief. HBS considers long-term consequences and transition pathways from the outset.

**In practice:**
- Multi-year planning horizons
- Investment in systemic change
- Exit strategies built into program design
- Link between humanitarian and development programming

### 2.5 Inclusive Participation

All affected populations, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups, must have meaningful opportunities to participate in and benefit from budget support.

**In practice:**
- Gender-responsive programming
- Inclusion of persons with disabilities
- Attention to age, ethnicity, and other diversity factors
- Barrier-free participation mechanisms

### 2.6 Evidence-Based Decision Making

Budget support decisions should rest on solid evidence, rigorous analysis, and learning from experience.

**In practice:**
- Context analysis and needs assessment
- Political economy analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems

### 2.7 Adaptive Learning

Humanitarian contexts are dynamic and uncertain. HBS incorporates flexibility, experimentation, and continuous learning.

**In practice:**
- Regular review and course correction
- Safe spaces for innovation and testing
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Integration of feedback loops

### 2.8 Do No Harm

Budget support must not exacerbate conflict, inequality, or vulnerability. Potential negative consequences must be anticipated and mitigated.

**In practice:**
- Conflict sensitivity analysis
- Environmental and social safeguards
- Protection mainstreaming
- Regular harm monitoring
