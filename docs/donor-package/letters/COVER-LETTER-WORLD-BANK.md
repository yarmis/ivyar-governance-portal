**To:** World Bank Governance Global Practice / Digital Development  
**From:** IVYAR Governance Platform, Cognitive Governance Division  
**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Subject:** Introduction of the Autopilot Decision Engine — Proposal for Collaboration on Governance Strengthening and Institutional Modernization

---

Dear colleagues,

On behalf of the IVYAR Governance Platform, we are pleased to introduce the **Autopilot Decision Engine**, an operational digital module designed to support Ukraine's ongoing public sector modernization and strengthen institutional governance capacity.

## Overview

Autopilot provides scenario-based, rule-driven, and fully auditable decision support for government operators. The system ensures consistent application of administrative rules across regions, reduces fiduciary and operational risks, and enhances transparency in public service delivery.

Each decision generated by Autopilot includes a structured outcome, a risk assessment score, a detailed explanation, and an immutable audit log aligned with international governance standards.

## Current Production Status

The module is currently **operational** with three production scenarios:

1. **Construction Risk Assessment** — Supporting infrastructure governance and risk mitigation
2. **Procurement Integrity Check** — Strengthening procurement oversight and compliance
3. **Social Support Case Evaluation** — Improving equity and consistency in social protection programs

## Alignment with World Bank Priorities

Autopilot aligns with the World Bank's priorities in:

- ✅ **Institutional Strengthening**
- ✅ **Public Sector Modernization**
- ✅ **Governance and Accountability**
- ✅ **Fiduciary Risk Reduction**
- ✅ **Digital Public Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Long-term Sustainability of Reforms**

## Value Proposition

We believe Autopilot can serve as a scalable foundation for transparent, efficient, and accountable administrative processes across multiple sectors. The system is ready for pilot deployment, institutional assessment, and integration into broader governance reform programs.

## Request for Collaboration

We respectfully request the opportunity to:

1. **Present the system** to relevant World Bank teams
2. **Explore potential collaboration** on pilot implementation
3. **Assess opportunities** for scaling across ministries
4. **Align Autopilot** with ongoing World Bank-supported reforms in Ukraine

## Sustainability

The system is designed for long-term sustainability:
- Low operational and maintenance costs
- Modular scenario expansion
- Alignment with national digital strategies
- Capacity building for civil servants
- Integration with government registries

## Next Steps

We would be honored to schedule a presentation and discussion at your earliest convenience to explore how Autopilot can support the World Bank's institutional strengthening objectives in Ukraine.
