**To:** USAID Ukraine Governance & Anti-Corruption Teams  
**From:** IVYAR Governance Platform, Cognitive Governance Division  
**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Subject:** Introduction of the Autopilot Decision Engine — Request for Partnership and Support

---

Dear colleagues,

On behalf of the IVYAR Governance Platform, we are pleased to present the **Autopilot Decision Engine**, a national-level digital module designed to strengthen transparency, accountability, and consistency across public administration processes in Ukraine.

## Overview

Autopilot provides scenario-based, explainable, and fully auditable decision support for government operators. It ensures that identical cases receive identical outcomes, reduces opportunities for human error or subjective interpretation, and creates a transparent audit trail aligned with international governance and anti-corruption standards.

## Current Status

The system is already **operational** with three production scenarios:

1. **Construction Risk Assessment** — Evaluates risks in construction contracts
2. **Procurement Integrity Check** — Identifies red flags in public procurement
3. **Social Support Case Evaluation** — Assesses eligibility for social programs

Each decision generated by Autopilot includes:
- A structured status (approve / review / reject)
- A risk score (0-100)
- A detailed explanation
- References to the rules and criteria applied
- A unique audit log stored in immutable form

## Alignment with USAID Priorities

This approach directly supports USAID priorities in:
- ✅ **Anti-Corruption Strategy (2022-2030)**
- ✅ **Digital Strategy (2020-2024)**
- ✅ **Democracy, Human Rights & Governance (DRG)**
- ✅ **Public Administration Reform**
- ✅ **Transparency & Accountability Initiatives**

## Request for Partnership

We believe Autopilot can become a foundational component of Ukraine's digital public infrastructure, enabling transparent service delivery, strengthening governance, and providing donors with verifiable, reproducible evidence of decision-making integrity.

We kindly request the opportunity to:

1. **Present the system** to your governance and digital transformation teams
2. **Explore potential collaboration** on pilot deployment
3. **Discuss opportunities** for scaling, scenario expansion, and capacity building
4. **Align Autopilot** with ongoing USAID-supported reforms

## Next Steps

We would be honored to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to demonstrate the system and discuss potential partnership opportunities.
