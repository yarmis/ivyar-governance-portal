🚀 Excited to announce: IVYAR Governance Platform is now LIVE!

After 13 years as a Boeing 787 systems engineer and serving as a chaplain with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, I witnessed firsthand how corruption in veteran land allocation destroys trust in institutions.

That's why I built IVYAR - an AI-powered governance platform designed to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to institutional decision-making.

🎯 What we've built:

✅ AI Autopilot - Explainable decision engine for institutional governance
✅ Public Feedback System - Real-time citizen engagement tools
✅ Anti-Corruption AI - Automated detection and prevention
✅ Multilingual Support - Currently US/UA/ES, 30+ languages ready
✅ NATO-Grade Security - 99.97% uptime, zero vulnerabilities

🌍 Ready to serve 9.6M+ users

💡 The Vision:
Transform how governments, NGOs, and development institutions operate - from opaque bureaucracies to transparent, AI-assisted systems that serve people, not politics.

🎓 Built on lessons from:
→ Boeing: Systems engineering excellence
→ Seminary: Ethical frameworks for AI
→ Ukraine: Understanding corruption's real-world impact

🔗 Live Demo: www.ivyar.org

This is just the beginning. If you're working in:
- Development institutions (World Bank, USAID, IFIs)
- Democracy & governance programs
- Defense innovation (NATO DIANA)
- Anti-corruption initiatives

Let's connect. I'd love to show you how IVYAR can support your mission.
