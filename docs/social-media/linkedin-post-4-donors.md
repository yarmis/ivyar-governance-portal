📢 Calling Development Institutions, NGOs, and Democracy Funders

If you're working on:
- Anti-corruption initiatives
- Democratic governance programs
- Institutional transparency
- Citizen engagement
- Development project oversight

I have something to show you.

🎯 The Challenge:

You're funding important projects worldwide, but:
→ How do you verify funds reach intended beneficiaries?
→ How do you measure real-time impact?
→ How do you prevent corruption in implementation?
→ How do you ensure citizen voices are heard?

Traditional monitoring systems aren't built for this.
