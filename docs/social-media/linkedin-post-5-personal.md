🛫 From Boeing Engineer to GovTech Founder: A Journey

13 years at Boeing. 787 Dreamliner systems. Six-figure salary. Comfortable life.

Then everything changed.

🇺🇦 My mother's homeland, Ukraine, was invaded.

I left Boeing. Enrolled in seminary. Became ordained. Deployed to Ukraine as a military chaplain.

What I saw there broke me—and rebuilt me.

💔 The Breaking Point:

Veterans who lost limbs defending their country were waiting months for land allocation that was rightfully theirs.

Not because of lack of land. Not because of lack of laws.

Because of corruption. Manual processes. Opaque systems. Zero accountability.

I watched a 23-year-old who lost both legs ask me: "Father, did I fight for this?"

I had no answer.

💡 The Rebuild:

Boeing taught me systems engineering.
Seminary taught me ethical frameworks.
Ukraine taught me what's at stake.

I combined all three to build IVYAR.

🎯 The Mission:

Build AI governance systems so transparent, so accountable, that corruption becomes impossible—not because people are good, but because the system won't allow it.

🚀 Today:

✅ IVYAR Governance Platform is LIVE
✅ Production-ready for millions of users
✅ AI-powered transparency tools
✅ 20+ governance modules
✅ Trusted by leading institutions

🌍 The Vision:

This isn't about Ukraine alone. It's about every veteran, every citizen, every person who deserves a government that serves them.

Technology exists to solve this. We just need the will.

🙏 To Everyone Who Helped:

My Boeing mentors who taught me excellence.
My seminary professors who taught me ethics.
My Ukrainian brothers and sisters who taught me courage.
The developers, advisors, and believers who made this real.

Thank you.
