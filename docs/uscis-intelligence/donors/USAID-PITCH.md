The Challenge: Information Inequality

Millions of migrants lack access to clear, reliable information
- High error rates disproportionately affect vulnerable populations
- Families face delays, uncertainty, and financial burden
- Language barriers compound existing challenges
- Information gaps create inequality in outcomes
- Vulnerable groups have limited access to legal counsel

The Human Cost:
- Families separated longer due to avoidable errors
- Financial hardship from delays and mistakes
- Reduced trust in institutions
- Exploitation by unscrupulous actors
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"This isn't just an administrative challenge—it's about real people and real families. When someone can't access clear information, they face delays, financial hardship, and sometimes separation from loved ones."
