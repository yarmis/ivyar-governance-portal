✓ No form completion—explains what forms are, not how to fill them
✓ No case-specific strategy—general information only

System-Level Safeguards:
✓ No USCIS.gov integration—zero system access
✓ No form submission capability—technical impossibility
✓ No data storage—no personal information retained
✓ No authentication—no user accounts or login

AI Guardrails:
✓ Refusal patterns for risky queries
✓ Mandatory disclaimers in every response
✓ Attorney referral built into system prompts
✓ Extra-cautious handling of humanitarian cases

Legal Review:
✓ Prompts reviewed for compliance
✓ No language that could constitute legal advice
✓ Transparent about limitations
✓ Encourages professional legal counsel
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Multiple layers of safeguards: system architecture, AI prompts, and operational procedures all prevent legal risk."

```
Supporting USCIS Within DHS Framework

USCIS Intelligence complements existing DHS systems:

[Diagram showing relationship]

Official USCIS Systems
├─ USCIS.gov (official information)
├─ Case status checking (myUSCIS)
├─ Form filing systems
└─ Processing infrastructure

↓ No connection, no integration

Informational Support Layer
└─ USCIS Intelligence (read-only guidance)

How They Work Together:
- USCIS Intelligence provides pre-application guidance
- Users still file through official USCIS channels
- Official systems remain authoritative
- No data flows between layers
- Complete separation maintained

Benefits of Separation:
- No security risk to official systems
- No legal liability for USCIS
- Easy to disable if needed
- No operational dependencies
- Maintains system integrity
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"This supports USCIS without integration—complete separation protects official systems while still providing operational benefits."
