Systemic Challenge: Information Asymmetry at Scale

System Inefficiencies:
- Immigration systems globally are complex and resource-intensive
- Information asymmetry creates transaction costs
- Applicants lack structured access to reliable information
- Inconsistent information sources reduce system efficiency
- High error rates generate rework and delays
- Administrative costs compound across entire system

Economic Impact:
- Staff resources consumed by routine inquiries
- Processing delays create economic inefficiency
- Error-driven resubmissions waste resources
- Incomplete applications burden case processing
- Lack of clarity increases overall system costs
- Vulnerable populations face disproportionate barriers

Infrastructure Gap:
- No standardized informational layer
- Fragmented communication channels
- Limited scalability of current approaches
- Technology deployment lags service needs
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Immigration information delivery faces systemic inefficiencies: high costs, resource waste, and limited scalability."
