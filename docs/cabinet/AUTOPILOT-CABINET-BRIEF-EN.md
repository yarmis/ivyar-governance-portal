Ukraine faces systemic challenges in public administration:

Autopilot is a **scenario-driven government module** that:

- Analyzes cases according to predefined rules
- Uses **LLM-enhanced reasoning** within government policy frameworks
- Operates exclusively within state norms and regulations

This is not a "black box."  
This is a controlled, transparent, audit-ready instrument.
