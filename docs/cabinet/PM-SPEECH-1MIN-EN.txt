AUTOPILOT DECISION ENGINE
1-Minute Speech for Prime Minister
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine

---

Honorable Prime Minister,

Today we present a government module that fundamentally changes how the state makes decisions.

Across Ukraine, different regions make different decisions under identical conditions. Rules are interpreted differently. Audits are slow, and citizens lack confidence in fairness.

Autopilot Decision Engine solves this.

It is a national-level system that evaluates cases using predefined scenarios—construction, procurement, social support—and produces transparent, explainable, auditable decisions in seconds.

How it works:
An operator selects a scenario, enters case data, and Autopilot analyzes it using government regulations and controlled reasoning. The system returns a structured decision with status, score, explanation, and references to the laws applied.

Every decision is logged and auditable.

For the state, this means:
- Unified standards across all regions
- Reduced corruption risks
- Faster case processing
- Full transparency for oversight

For international partners, this means:
- Verifiable decisions
- Reduced corruption risks
- Donor-grade transparency

Autopilot is already operational. Three scenarios are live. The system is ready for Cabinet approval and pilot deployment.

This is not just a tool—this is a governance standard. A foundation for transparent, data-driven public administration.

Thank you.
