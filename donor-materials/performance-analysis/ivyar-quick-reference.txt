 ❓ COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"This is unproven technology"
→ We have 193 tested API endpoints, 100% pass rate, production-grade
  quality. Tech stack is proven: Next.js + Vercel powers the world's
  largest platforms.

"Government sales cycles are too long"
→ We're targeting 9-12 months, which is 40% faster than industry
  average. Our platform is already built - no development delays.

"You're too small"
→ We're founder-led but production-ready. Our tech allows us to
  deliver what would take competitors years with 100+ engineers.
  Lean = fast = competitive advantage.

"Security concerns"
→ Platform designed for ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR, PQC compliance.
  Security audit scheduled Q1. Vercel provides enterprise-grade
  infrastructure with 99.9% SLA.

"What about competitors?"
→ Palantir: 10x more expensive, legacy architecture
  Tyler Tech: US-only, municipal focus, outdated
  SAP: Complex, slow, poor UX
  Us: Modern, fast, global, transparent, ethical AI

 🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Single Founder Risk
   → Mitigation: Documentation, team hiring plan, operational systems

2. No Customers Yet
   → Mitigation: 5 partners ready to demo, strong pipeline building

3. Long Sales Cycles
   → Mitigation: Target 3-5 contracts Year 1, diversify verticals

4. Government Dependency
   → Mitigation: Multi-sector strategy (NGOs, banks, corporations)
