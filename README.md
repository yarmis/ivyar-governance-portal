**Tone:**
- Confident professional (not salesy)
- Authentic personal story (chaplain experience)
- Focus on proof, not potential

**Mouse Movements:**
- Slow and deliberate during platform navigation
- Show you're comfortable with the system
- This proves it's not a staged demo

**Closing:**
- End with confidence: "We're ready to scale. The question is: are you ready to rebuild trust?"
- Smile during Q&A—you know your system better than anyone
